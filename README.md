# Segmenting Stomach Mecical Images with UNet

The main objective of this assignment is to train and evaluate a U-Net model for bi-
nary image segmentation, particularly focused on medical images related to stomach

segmentation. The U-Net architecture is well-suited for medical image analysis, offer-
ing precise localization through an encoder-decoder structure with skip connections.

The assignment consists of separate scripts for training and testing, along with utility
modules for data handling, visualization, and metric computation.
The data provided is from a public dataset used in a Kaggle competition called
UW-Madison GI Tract Image Segmentation.
